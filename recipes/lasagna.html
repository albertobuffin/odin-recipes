        <p>This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! There's something so amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna.  Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm, comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).</p>
